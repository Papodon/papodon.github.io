					<p class="text"> Welcome to Belanos, a website inspired by the solarpunk movement 
                        and dedicated to creating a sustainable future that's deeply interconnected with nature 
                        and community.

                    <p class="text"> At Belanos, we believe that technology can play an integral role 
                        in building a better world. 
                        We envision a future where technology is not just a tool for profit and efficiency, 
                        but a means of creating a more harmonious relationship between humans and the natural world.
                        
                    <p class="text"> As part of the indieweb, Belanos is committed to decentralization 
                        and empowering individuals to own and control their online presence. 
                        We believe that the internet should be a place for community and collaboration, 
                        not just a marketplace for big tech companies.
                            
                    <p class="text"> At Belanos, we are optimistic about the future. We believe that by coming together and harnessing the power of technology, 
                        we can build a world that's sustainable, just, and equitable for all.
